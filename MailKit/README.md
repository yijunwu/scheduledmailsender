## Goals

The main goal of this project is to optimize for mobile platforms such as Android, iOS, and eventually Windows Phone 8.
This means that IMAP extensions such as CONDSTORE, QRESYNC, and any other extensions that allow clients to reduce
network traffic (IDLE? ESEARCH? COMPRESS?) will take priority over any of the other extensions. After that, the most
common extensions will take precedence over the lesser-used extensions until finally all of the extensions anyone
actually cares about are implemented.

At some point in the (near?) future, I'd also like to start using async/await. For those who are stuck in .NET 4.0,
Microsoft has released an
[Async Targetting Pack](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bclteam/archive/2013/04/17/microsoft-bcl-async-is-now-stable.aspx)
on [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bcl.Async) which allows the use of the async/await keywords on
pre-.NET 4.5 platforms. If you haven't already, I'd highly recommend installing it.

## Installing via NuGet

The easiest way to install MimeKit is via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MailKit/).

In Visual Studio's [Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console),
simply enter the following command:

    Install-Package MailKit

## Building

First, you'll need to clone MailKit, MimeKit, Bouncy Castle, and Portable.Text.Encoding from my GitHub repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit.git
    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit.git
    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/bc-csharp.git
    git clone https://github.com/jstedfast/Portable.Text.Encoding.git

Currently, MailKit (through its use of MimeKit) depends on the visual-studio-2010 branch of bc-csharp for
the Visual Studio 2010 project files that I've added (to replace the Visual Studio 2003 project files).
To switch to that branch,

    cd bc-csharp
    git checkout -b visual-studio-2010 origin/visual-studio-2010

In the top-level MailKit source directory, there are three solution files: MailKit.sln, MailKit.Net40.sln and MailKit.Mobile.sln.

* MailKit.Mobile.sln just includes the Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android projects.
* MailKit.Net40.sln just includes the .NET Framework 4.0 C# project (MailKit/MailKit.csproj)
* MailKit.sln includes everything that is in the MailKit.Net40.sln solution as well as the projects for Xamarin.Android,
Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Mac.

If you don't have the Xamarin products, you'll probably want to open the MailKit.Net45.sln instead of MailKit.sln.

Once you've opened the appropriate MailKit solution file in either Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio 2010+ (either will work),
you can simply choose the Debug or Release build configuration and then build.

Note: The Release build will generate the xml API documentation, but the Debug build will not.

## Using MailKit

### Sending Messages

One of the more common operations that MailKit is meant for is sending email messages.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Threading;

using MailKit.Net.Smtp;
using MailKit;
using MimeKit;

namespace TestClient {
	class Program
	{
		public static void Main (string[] args)
		{
			var message = new MimeMessage ();
			message.From.Add (new MailboxAddress ("Joey Tribbiani", "joey@friends.com"));
			message.To.Add (new MailboxAddress ("Mrs. Chanandler Bong", "chandler@friends.com"));
			message.Subject = "How you doin'?";

			message.Body = new TextPart ("plain") {
				Text = @"Hey Chandler,

I just wanted to let you know that Monica and I were going to go play some paintball, you in?

-- Joey"
			};

			using (var client = new SmtpClient ()) {
				var credentials = new NetworkCredential ("joey", "password");

				// Note: if the server requires SSL-on-connect, use the "smtps" protocol instead
				var uri = new Uri ("smtp://smtp.gmail.com:587");

				using (var cancel = new CancellationTokenSource ()) {
					client.Connect (uri, cancel.Token);

					// Note: since we don't have an OAuth2 token, disable
					// the XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism.
					client.AuthenticationMechanisms.Remove ("XOAUTH2");

					// Note: only needed if the SMTP server requires authentication
					client.Authenticate (credentials, cancel.Token);

					client.Send (message, cancel.Token);
					client.Disconnect (true, cancel.Token);
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Retrieving Messages (via Pop3)

One of the other main uses of MailKit is retrieving messages from pop3 servers.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Threading;

using MailKit.Net.Pop3;
using MailKit;
using MimeKit;

namespace TestClient {
	class Program
	{
		public static void Main (string[] args)
		{
			using (var client = new Pop3Client ()) {
				var credentials = new NetworkCredential ("joey", "password");

				// Note: if the server requires SSL-on-connect, use the "pops" protocol instead
				var uri = new Uri ("pop://mail.friends.com");

				using (var cancel = new CancellationTokenSource ()) {
					client.Connect (uri, cancel.Token);

					// Note: since we don't have an OAuth2 token, disable
					// the XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism.
					client.AuthenticationMechanisms.Remove ("XOAUTH2");

					client.Authenticate (credentials, cancel.Token);

					int count = client.GetMessageCount (cancel.Token);
					for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
						var message = client.GetMessage (i, cancel.Token);
						Console.WriteLine ("Subject: {0}", message.Subject);
					}

					client.Disconnect (true, cancel.Token);
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Using IMAP

More important than POP3 support is the IMAP support. Here's a simple use-case of retreiving messages from an IMAP server:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Threading;

using MailKit.Net.Imap;
using MailKit.Search;
using MailKit;
using MimeKit;

namespace TestClient {
	class Program
	{
		public static void Main (string[] args)
		{
			using (var client = new ImapClient ()) {
				var credentials = new NetworkCredential ("joey", "password");
				var uri = new Uri ("imaps://imap.gmail.com");

				using (var cancel = new CancellationTokenSource ()) {
					client.Connect (uri, cancel.Token);

					// Note: since we don't have an OAuth2 token, disable
					// the XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism.
					client.AuthenticationMechanisms.Remove ("XOAUTH");

					client.Authenticate (credentials, cancel.Token);

					// The Inbox folder is always available on all IMAP servers...
					var inbox = client.Inbox;
					inbox.Open (FolderAccess.ReadOnly, cancel.Token);

					Console.WriteLine ("Total messages: {0}", inbox.Count);
					Console.WriteLine ("Recent messages: {0}", inbox.Recent);

					for (int i = 0; i < inbox.Count; i++) {
						var message = inbox.GetMessage (i, cancel.Token);
						Console.WriteLine ("Subject: {0}", message.Subject);
					}

					client.Disconnect (true, cancel.Token);
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

However, you probably want to do more complicated things with IMAP such as fetching summary information
so that you can display a list of messages in a mail client without having to first download all of the
messages from the server:

```csharp
foreach (var summary in inbox.Fetch (0, -1, MessageSummaryItems.Full, cancel.Token)) {
	Console.WriteLine ("[summary] {0:D2}: {1}", summary.Index, summary.Envelope.Subject);
}
```

The results of a Fetch command can also be used to download individual MIME parts rather
than downloading the entire message. For example:

```csharp
foreach (var summary in inbox.Fetch (0, -1, MessageSummaryItems.Full, cancel.Token)) {
	var text = summary.Body as BodyPartText;

	if (text == null) {
		var multipart = summary.Body as BodyPartMultipart;

		if (multipart != null)
			text = multipart.BodyParts.OfType<BodyPartText> ().FirstOrDefault ();
	}

	if (text == null)
		continue;

	// this will download *just* the text part
	var part = inbox.GetBodyPart (summary.Index, text, cancel.Token);
}
```

You may also be interested in sorting and searching...

```csharp
// let's search for all messages received after Jan 12, 2013 with "MailKit" in the subject...
var query = SearchQuery.DeliveredAfter (DateTime.Parse ("2013-01-12"))
    .And (SearchQuery.SubjectContains ("MailKit")).And (SearchQuery.Seen);

foreach (var uid in inbox.Search (query, cancel.Token)) {
	var message = inbox.GetMessage (uid, cancel.Token);
	Console.WriteLine ("[match] {0}: {1}", uid, message.Subject);
}

// let's do the same search, but this time sort them in reverse arrival order
var orderBy = new [] { OrderBy.ReverseArrival };
foreach (var uid in inbox.Search (query, orderBy, cancel.Token)) {
	var message = inbox.GetMessage (uid, cancel.Token);
	Console.WriteLine ("[match] {0}: {1}", uid, message.Subject);
}

// you'll notice that the orderBy argument is an array... this is because you
// can actually sort the search results based on multiple columns:
orderBy = new [] { OrderBy.ReverseArrival, OrderBy.Subject };
foreach (var uid in inbox.Search (query, orderBy, cancel.Token)) {
	var message = inbox.GetMessage (uid, cancel.Token);
	Console.WriteLine ("[match] {0}: {1}", uid, message.Subject);
}
```

Of course, instead of downloading the message, you could also fetch the summary information for the matching messages
or do any of a number of other things with the UIDs that are returned.

How about navigating folders? MailKit can do that, too:

```csharp
// Get the first personal namespace and list the toplevel folders under it.
var personal = client.GetFolder (client.PersonalNamespaces[0]);
foreach (var folder in personal.GetSubfolders (false, cancel.Token))
	Console.WriteLine ("[folder] {0}", folder.Name);
```

If the IMAP server supports the SPECIAL-USE or the XLIST (GMail) extension, you can get ahold of
the pre-defined All, Drafts, Flagged (aka Important), Junk, Sent, Trash, etc folders like this:

```csharp
if ((client.Capabilities & (ImapCapabilities.SpecialUse | ImapCapabilities.XList)) != 0) {
	var drafts = client.GetFolder (SpecialFolder.Drafts);
} else {
	// maybe check the user's preferences for the Drafts folder?
}
```

In cases where the IMAP server does *not* support the SPECIAL-USE or XLIST extensions, you'll have to
come up with your own heuristics for getting the Sent, Drafts, Trash, etc folders. For example, you
might use logic similar to this:

```csharp
static string[] CommonSentFolderNames = { "Sent Items", "Sent Mail", /* maybe add some translated names */ };

static IFolder GetSentFolder (ImapClient client, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var personal = client.GetFolder (client.PersonalNamespaces[0]);

    foreach (var folder in personal.GetSubfolders (false, cancellationToken)) {
        foreach (var name in CommonSentFolderNames) {
            if (folder.Name == commonName)
                return folder;
        }
    }

    return null;
}
```

Using LINQ, you could simplify this down to something more like this:

```csharp
static string[] CommonSentFolderNames = { "Sent Items", "Sent Mail", /* maybe add some translated names */ };

static IFolder GetSentFolder (ImapClient client, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var personal = client.GetFolder (client.PersonalNamespaces[0]);
    
    return personal.GetSubfolders (false, cancellationToken).FirstOrDefault (x => CommonSentFolderNames.Contains (x.Name));
}
```

Another option might be to allow the user of your application to configure which folder he or she wants to use as their Sent folder, Drafts folder, Trash folder, etc.

How you handle this is up to you.
